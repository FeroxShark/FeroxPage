# Welcome to Ferox's Personal GitHub Page

Hello there! My name is Ferox. As a high school student, I am passionate about technology and have embarked on my journey into the realm of software development. This personal page serves as a portal into my world, offering a glimpse into who I am and what I am learning.

## Features of My Page

### Welcome Message with an Animated Twist

As you land on my page, you are greeted with a welcome message. But it's not just a static text! I have added a touch of JavaScript to animate the element. The message deciphers itself upon the loading of the page, making your welcome a bit more dynamic and interesting!

### Getting to Know Me

In the "About Me" section, you'll find a brief introduction about myself. I've shared a bit about my enthusiasm for technology, my budding journey into software development, and a sprinkle of personal interests. 

### Interactive Content Boxes

The content boxes are my canvas for sharing my learning experiences and creations. As I delve deeper into technology, learn new concepts, and work on various projects, these boxes will reflect my growth and evolution.

### Reach Out to Me

If you wish to contact me, I've got you covered. I've dedicated a section of the page to my contact information. Whether you have a question, an idea, or simply want to say hi, feel free to drop me a message.

### Footer with a Fun Element

The footer of my page has a unique interactive feature. At first, it presents a random string, but as you hover over it, it 'deciphers' itself into a set of random words. This feature, implemented using JavaScript, adds a playful touch to the page.

### Real-Time Weather Information

One of the highlights of my page is the weather display feature. It fetches and presents the current weather based on your location. This serves as my first attempt to work with APIs, creating an interactive element that provides real-time information.

### Chat with SharkAI

You can interact with SharkAI, a simulated chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. Just type in your message and press Enter or the send button to see SharkAI's response. Remember, the responses are generated by an AI and for demonstration purposes.

## Behind the Scenes

The backbone of this page is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've harnessed the power of JavaScript to animate the text, fetch weather data, and enable the chat function, while CSS breathes life into the layout with styling. If you're interested in the nuts and bolts that make this page work, you're more than welcome to explore the code.

## Setting Up

To run this project, you'll need to have two environment variables set up:

- `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY`: Your OpenWeatherMap API Key for fetching real-time weather information. You can get it from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) after signing up.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API Key for fetching responses from GPT-3.5-turbo. You can get it from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) after signing up.

You can set these environment variables in your system or in a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Be sure not to commit the `.env` file to any public repository as it contains sensitive information.

Please note that the OpenAI API key is used on the client side in this project for demonstration purposes, which is not recommended for production applications due to security reasons. In a production application, you should create a server that handles requests to the OpenAI API.

## Feedback

Your feedback is valuable and will help me improve the page. Feel free to share your thoughts or report any bugs/issues you encounter.

Happy exploring!
