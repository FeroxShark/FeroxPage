# Welcome to Ferox's Personal GitHub Page

Hello! I'm Ferox. I'm currently a high school student and I'm passionate about technology and beginning my journey into software development. This is my personal page where you can learn a bit more about me.

## Features of My Page

### Animated Welcome Message

The welcome message on my page is more than a static text; it's an animated element that deciphers itself when you load the page. This feature is one of my early experiments with JavaScript.

### About Me Section

In the "About Me" section, you'll find some basic information about me. I've shared a bit about my interests and why I'm excited about software development.

### Content Boxes

The content boxes are a space where I can share content as I continue learning and creating. As I work on more projects and learn more technologies, I'll be updating this space.

### Contact Information

There's a section on the page where you can find my contact information. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to drop me a line.

### Dynamic Footer

The footer of the page has a unique feature. It starts with a random string that is 'deciphered' into a set of random words when you hover over it. It's just a fun little feature I implemented using JavaScript.

### Weather Display

The page also includes a weather display feature. It fetches and displays the current weather based on the visitor's location. This is my initial attempt at working with APIs.

## Behind the Scenes

The page is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've used JavaScript for the text animation and weather display feature, and CSS for styling. If you're curious about the implementation, feel free to explore the code.
